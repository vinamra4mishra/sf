McCulloch-Pitts Logic Gates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is the role of threshold in McCulloch-Pitts model?
A: It determines the activation of the neuron; output is 1 if weighted sum ≥ threshold, otherwise 0.

Q: What type of logic gates can McCulloch-Pitts simulate?
A: It can simulate basic binary logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.

Q: Why is this model considered binary?
A: Because it only deals with binary input and output values (0 or 1).



Hebb’s Rule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is Hebb’s learning rule?
A: It states that the connection between neurons is strengthened when they are activated together.

Q: Does Hebb’s rule use supervised learning?
A: No, it is an unsupervised learning rule.

Q: What is the biological inspiration for Hebb’s rule?
A: The principle 'neurons that fire together wire together' observed in neurobiology.



Kohonen Self Organizing Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What kind of learning is SOM based on?
A: Unsupervised learning.

Q: What is a Best Matching Unit (BMU)?
A: It is the neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input vector.

Q: Why is SOM useful in data visualization?
A: It reduces high-dimensional data into low-dimensional (usually 2D) maps for easy visualization.



Hamming Network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is Hamming distance?
A: It is the number of positions at which corresponding bits are different.

Q: What is the significance of minimum distance in this method?
A: The input is classified to the exemplar with the smallest Hamming distance.

Q: Can Hamming distance be used for non-binary inputs?
A: No, it is typically used for binary vectors.



BAM Network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What makes BAM bidirectional?
A: It can recall input from output and vice versa.

Q: What is the significance of Hebbian rule in BAM?
A: It is used to form associations between input and output patterns.

Q: How is stability ensured in BAM?
A: Through convergence via recurrent dynamics and symmetrical weight matrices.



MaxNet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is lateral inhibition?
A: A mechanism where neurons suppress the activity of their neighbors to enhance contrast.

Q: Why does MaxNet converge to one winning neuron?
A: Because all neurons except the one with maximum activation are gradually suppressed.

Q: Is MaxNet a feedforward or recurrent network?
A: It is a recurrent network.



De Morgan’s Law
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: State De Morgan's laws.
A: ~(A ∨ B) = ~A ∧ ~B and ~(A ∧ B) = ~A ∨ ~B.

Q: Why are these laws important in Boolean algebra?
A: They help in simplifying expressions and proving equivalences.

Q: Can you use these laws for logic simplification?
A: Yes, they are commonly used in logic circuit design and simplification.



Fuzzy Set Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How is fuzzy union different from crisp union?
A: Fuzzy union uses max(A(x), B(x)) instead of set union.

Q: What does complement of a fuzzy set represent?
A: It shows the degree to which an element does not belong to the set.

Q: What is a membership function?
A: It defines how each element maps to a degree of membership in the fuzzy set.



Fuzzy Cartesian Product
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is a fuzzy relation?
A: A fuzzy set defined on the Cartesian product of two universes.

Q: How is fuzzy Cartesian product computed?
A: By taking min(A(x), B(y)) for each pair (x, y).

Q: How are fuzzy relations visualized?
A: Using tables, matrices, or heatmaps.



Max–Min Composition of Fuzzy Relations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What does max–min composition represent?
A: It models how fuzzy relations combine to infer indirect relations.

Q: How is it different from Cartesian product?
A: Cartesian product uses direct pairs, while max–min composition involves intermediate variables.

Q: What are applications of fuzzy composition?
A: Decision-making, fuzzy inference systems, and control systems.
